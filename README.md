# Feedforward Classification Network
## 2021 Spring, Deep Learning Homework 1
### HW Instructions
You are given the dataset of medical images (MedMNIST.zip). This dataset contains 6 classes. In this exercise, you need to implement a feedforward neural network (FNN) model by yourself to recognize radiological images, and use specified algorithms to update the parameters.

1. Design a FNN model architecture and perform the random initialization for model weights. Run backpropagation algorithm and use mini-batch SGD (stochastic gradient descent) to optimize the parameters

2. Implement a flexible program that can parse the arguments to generate a specific FNN model but without bias for each neuron, and also need to run backpropagation algorithm and use mini-batch SGD to optimize the parameters
